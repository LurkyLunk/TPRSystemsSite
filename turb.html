      <h3>Precision Manufactured Replacement Parts & Repairs</h3>
      <p>
        TPR Systems, Inc was established in 2002 to provide Turbine Parts and
        Turbine Parts Repair Services to our customers. It has been the backbone
        and driving force that led us to provide a large number of services we
        offer today.
      </p>
      <p>
        We learned early about the importance of manufacturing our own
        replacement parts in-house and eventually were able to manufacture brand
        new replacement parts or entire replacement stators for certain model
        SOLAR turbine engines.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of our reputation of high-quality and impeccable precision
        machining, we have been successful in the stator repair and
        manufacturing market. Our dedication to continually bringing innovative
        and resourceful advances to the production process and/or the end
        product, has proven to our clients and the industry as a whole, that TPR
        Systems, Inc is a major player and puts the advancement of technology,
        production, and manufacturing and how it relates to the needs of our
        customers, above all else.
