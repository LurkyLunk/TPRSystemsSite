        steps in the manufacturing process. From the highest quality American
        forged and rolled, stainless steel used to manufacture our stator
        products, to the final steps of inspection steps in our manufacturing
        process,<strong>
          TPR Systems, Inc Compressor Stators are 100% built in the United
          States and within our own facilities.

      </p>

      <p><strong>What is process control you ask?</strong></p>

      <p>
        In our industry process control is the manner in which we handle the
        steps in manufacturing of a product from start to finish. Our products
        are manufactured in a highly controlled and enclosed atmosphere which
        utilizes innovative techniques such as custom brazing, inspection, and
        tolerances no other manufacturing company can match.
      </p>

      <p>
        This not only includes how we handle building our products but the
        communication between our staff members as well. We employ a highly
        skilled staff whose expertise is an absolute necessity in maintaining
        streamlined communications throughout every step of the process. This
        insures all stators are manufactured efficiently, effectively and of the
        absolute highest quality<strong>every time.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>TPR Systems, Inc'</strong> Stators go through a meticulous 1000
        point inspection which uses a CMM four times throughout the
        manufacturing process. This means every product is thoroughly inspected
        over 4000 times before it is ready for use. Controlling the
        manufacturing process from raw material, production and final inspection
        insures the final product is flawless and of the highest quality.
